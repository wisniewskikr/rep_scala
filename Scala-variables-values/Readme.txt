SCALA VARIABLES AND VALUES


Difference between variables and values is following:

1. Values (val in Scala)
Values are immutable. They are like final in Java.
You can not assign new value to this element.

2. Variables (var in Scala)
Variables are muttable. You can assign new value
to this element.
